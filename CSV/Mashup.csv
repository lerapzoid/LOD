The engine runs as a Wordpress plugin for ease of deployment and employs multiple layers of caching (database and flat-file HTML) to maximize site speed. However, most page refreshes will require cached data to be refetched from one or more web service - maximum cache time is between one hour and 12 hours, due to restrictions on caching imposed by web service providers.

Still, the results are very consistent, only limited by the accuracy of UPC data provided by third parties - at an estimate, less than 1% of UPC searches have products with wrongly-allocated UPCs.","Amazon Product Advertising, eBay Product Services, Commission Junction",Web,05.16.2017

With Explorr you can perform those three (or two, or five or more) searches simultaneously.

HTTPS version is also available and the URL gets updated with the tags you searched for, so you can easily bookmark the page.

Just below are latest tweets from location (refresh works too) as well as located news feed from google.

Little magic thing happens when a place name (or address/city) entered instead of detected IP.
For example Sherlock Holmes Museum - to see what's up at Baker Street -> OK.

Know the place and want to refresh memories? Or wanna check views of where never was before?
Look, geo photos from flickr on the right...
Click for the picture full details or browse for next.

Previous tweets from specified location (as far as available) are reachable.
These tweets location radius is adjustable as well (to investigate the exact place or wider range).

One more cool feature is you can refine tweets within that radius for specific search words.
For instance, to locate tweets with photos from these geotagged scope just enter word (at bottom left) photo -> click search within!
Well, links on these photos (usually from fb, instagram, twitter, tumblr and others) are clickable... 
Hm... looking for ... what if to enter instagram cats -> search within?

What are (they tweeting about) recent news in newspapers ... ok, let's check nytimes -> search within!
More results? Just click Radius+ to increase search area...

Still using google search? Better use (twitter geo powered) search within!

BTW, how about vine.co twitter videos from the place? Sure, click THE VINES to watch it playlisted...

Under tweets feel free to check what's top on Amazon by random category (at the moment from 10 available global locations)!

This represents a total potential market savings of $34 billion for facilitating correct use of primary care. 

Providing people with the tools they need to find appropriate care everywhere saves everyone, hospitals and patients, money and time.

Patients receive a SMS from triage.me post emergency room discharge. By sending a text to triage.me with their problem and current address, we route the person towards the nearest clinic, providing the address and a link to directions (for smartphone users).

Many clinics that work with the underinsured also often have variable hours and locations. We&#039;ve made it easy for these clinics to update their hours and location via SMS so that we can better route triage.me users to locations.","Google Maps, Bit.ly, Twilio, Google Maps Data",null,07.02.2012
